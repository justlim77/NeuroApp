    concludingTests:
    - Lumbar puncture
    - Hip internal rotation and abduction
    - HBA1c, B12
    - MRI lumbosacral spine
    - 
    localising: '1. Is it an UMN or LMN lesion? Absent ankle jerks and downgoing plantar
      responses suggest a LMN lesion, hence we can eliminate cortical to spinal cord
      lesions.


      2. Sensory loss rules out muscle, NMJ and AHC lesions.


      3. Bilateral and symmetrical involvement suggests plexus to be unlikely, hence
      it is eliminated.


      4. We are left with roots and peripheral nerves. Peripheral neuropathy is more
      likely, however the distal foot weakness is not a usual finding in peripheral
      neuropathy. We should keep bilateral L5/S1 radiculopathy as a secondary possibility
      as it is not uncommon, and also because lumbar nerve roots originate from a
      central point (cauda equina), and hence can be bilaterally involved.'

    answer: 1
    rationale: At this point, we still need to differentiate between a root vs a peripheral
      nerve problem. Clinically, weakness of hip internal rotation or hip abduction
      would suggest L5 radiculopathy over peripheral neuropathy.

    testQuestion: What would you examine next?
    concludingTests:
    - Rest of the cranial nerves
    - Visual field testing
    - Pupillary response
    - Fatiguability
    - Plantar response
    localising: "1. Is it an UMN or LMN lesion? Motor testing of the right UL suggests
      an UMN pattern of weakness \u2013 distally weaker and extensors of the UL are
      weaker.\n\n2. The presence of a facial droop suggests a lesion above the spinal
      cord.\n\n3. The disparate weakness involving the face and UL more than the LL
      suggest a cortical lesion such as one at the motor homunculus on the lateral
      surface of the cerebral hemisphere. This is called a brachiofacial pattern of
      weakness."

    - 
    answer: 1
    rationale: To confirm and delineate extent of cortical involvement, we routinely
      check for other cortical signs eg. visual fields, language, neglect, cortical
      sensory loss and apraxias. If none are present, then this would be called a
      brachiofacial syndrome.

    - '3. We are left with either a spinal cord lesion or an AHC lesion (note: normal
      sensory findings, hence we cannot rule out AHC just yet) '
    - 
    answer: 2
    rationale: A lesion at the C5/6 cervical spine causes absent bicep jerks (C5/C6)
      and absent supinator (C5/6) jerks, but brisk finger jerks (C8/T1), leading to
      the appearance of the inverted supinator jerks bilaterally. AHC lesions can
      cause a similar overall picture, however, usually there are mixed UMN and LMN
      signs, with the presence of LMN signs below UMN signs. In terms of investigations,
      it is always crucial to rule out spinal cord compression before anything else.
