//Gameplay

The patient's condition is randomized per game session. It draws from a list of conditions which can be edited via
the Condition Item Editor window. Based on the condition details, the patient will exhibit behaviors relating to
their underlying condition. The player must use tools such as the tendon tapper, pin prick, tuning fork, and power
chart to assess the patient and narrow down the possible conditions the patient could be suffering from. Finally,
the player will have to recommend a concluding test to be performed on the patient.
